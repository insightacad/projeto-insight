=====================================================

Seq-queue is simple tool to keep requests to be executed in order.

As we known, Node.js codes run in asynchronous mode and the callbacks are unordered. But sometimes we may need the requests to be processed in order. For example, in a game, a player would do some operations such as turn right and go ahead. And in the server side, we would like to process these requests one by one, not do them all at the same time.

Seq-queue takes the responsibility to make the asynchronous, unordered processing flow into serial and ordered. It's simple but not a repeated wheel.

Seq-queue is a FIFO task queue and we can push tasks as we wish, anytime(before the queue closed), anywhere(if we hold the queue instance). A task is known as a function and we can do anything in the function and just need to call `task.done()` to tell the queue current task has finished. It promises tha
